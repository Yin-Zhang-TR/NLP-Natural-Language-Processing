# NLP-Natural-Language-Processing
A Mind-Map of NLP Knowledge

I am trying to build a mind map to organize my knowledge of Natural Language Processing.

Each algorithm has three main parts:
  1. Principle: which trying to use sinple words to describe the main idea of a model/algorithm;
  2. Algorithm: which trying to determine the key structure of a model and main components of this model, also trying to collect important parts and details both of theory derivation and implimentation;
  3. Cons/Pros: which trying to describe the advantages and disadvantages of a model.
  
For each model/algorithm, I am trying to determine the path of evolution and internal relationship, because most new models/algorithms were created to resolve the problems which previous ones had not fixed or involved by them. This may help me to catch the linkings in NLP field and could help me to create a web of these knowledge.
